Include a header paragraph specific to your product here. Maintenance and support requirements address items specific to the ongoing maintenance and support of your product after delivery. Think of these requirements as if you were the ones who would be responsible for caring for customers/end user after the product is delivered in its final form and in use "in the field". What would you require to do this job? Specify items such as: where, how and who must be able to maintain the product to correct errors, hardware failures, etc.; required support/troubleshooting manuals/guides; availability/documentation of source code; related technical documentation that must be available for maintainers; specific/unique tools required for maintenance; specific software/environment required for maintenance; etc.
